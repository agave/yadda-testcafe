# How it works?

> Transforms Yadda features into working Testcafé tests.

It's based on [previous ideas for Nightwatch](https://github.com/tacoss/y2nw) BDD.

But instead of resolving steps on runtime we generate the code for usage on Testcafé.

## I want to break free!

- `npm install`
- `npm run e2e`

Inspect the generated results from E2E snapshots:

- `npm run ui`
- `open generated/index.html`
